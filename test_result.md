# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "Continue task request: Dashboard – Mintu Plast: For Mintu Plast, please prepare two separate graphs: One for Preform, One for Cap. Manage Existing Logs: On the "Manage Existing Logs" section, only show logs created by the logged-in user (i.e., logs they are allowed to edit or delete). Excel Export Fix: The Excel export function is not currently working. Please fix it. Also, ensure that: Factory users can only export data related to their own factory, Headquarter users can export data from all factories. CONTINUATION TASK: Report ID: Add a unique reportID to each report entry in the database. Dashboard Tab Layout: Move Factory Comparison Analytics - Today above the All Factories Overview - Production vs Sales Trends (30-Day Period) section. Interactive Popups: When clicking: A data point on any graph in the Dashboard tab, A row in the Report and Analytics tab table Show a popup card displaying detailed information for that data point or row. Factory Efficiency Explanation: Below the Factory Efficiency graph, display a short note explaining what it measures and how it's calculated. Excel Export Formatting: Improve the formatting of the exported Excel file to make it cleaner and easier to read"

Factory users cannot bypass filtering even with factory_id parameter. 2) Excel File Generation: openpyxl dependency working correctly, Excel files properly generated with two sheets (Daily Logs and Summary) containing all expected headers and data structure. 3) HTTP Headers: Correct MIME type (application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet) and Content-Disposition headers for proper file download with .xlsx extension. 4) Query Parameters: Date range filtering (start_date, end_date) and factory_id parameter work correctly. 5) Authentication: Properly requires bearer token authentication, correctly rejects invalid tokens. 6) Edge Cases: Returns 404 with appropriate error message when no data matches search criteria. Excel export endpoint at /api/export-excel is fully functional with no critical issues found."
